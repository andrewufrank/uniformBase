Haskell}\label{an-new-start-for-an-ide-for-haskell}}

The current theorie is to combine components to achieve an Integrated
Development Environment. The components must build on the existing base
tools:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ghc compiler
\item
  cabal and stack to manage packages and link them together
\item
  git for versioning and storage management
\item
  VScode, for editing and visualizationThis is a minimal Haskell project
  with a library and some routines which all do nothing.
\end{itemize}

I used it for experimenting with data types, but the interest here is
the integration with a Haskell IDE, namely the use of ghcide with
VScode.
