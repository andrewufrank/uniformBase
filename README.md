# UniformBase

The package imports separately compilable and usable packages. This package and all its parts are self-contained and need no further imports; no need to import the subpackages individually.

The package depends indirectly on many often used packages but some concentration is planned in the future, using other attemps with similar goals. 

libraries required:
