versitiy and research institutes:

Long term centralized storage: The management of electronic documentsproduced
by ourselves or received from othersand the long-term storage of them
for a group of related workers.
 Centralized storage of paper documents.
 Management of versions of documents:
Electronic documents tend to
evolve through a multitude of versions, sometimes in linear succession,
sometimes in parallel variants.
These issues are usually treated unsystematically and separatedly.
