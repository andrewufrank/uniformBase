synopsis:           a uniform base to build apps on
category:           Programming Uniform 

# To avoid duplicated efforts in documentation and dealing with the
# complications of embedding Haddock markup inside cabal files, it is
# common to point users to the README.md file.

  Uniform goals:
  - same functions with identical semantics independent of representation
  - all functions are total (or become so using Maybe or Either)
  - performance is NOT a goal - once the program logic is confirmed and tested, performance improvements can be achieved based on observations. The goal for "uniform" is reducing the complexity for the designer of a program - performance improvement come when the logic is correct.
