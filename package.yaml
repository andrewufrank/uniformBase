synopsis:           A uniform base to build apps on
category:           Programming Uniform 

# To avoid duplicated efforts in documentation and dealing with the
# complications of embedding Haddock markup inside cabal files, it is
# common to point users to the README.md file.

  Goals:

    - reducing the complexity for the programmer of applications, 

    - functions with identical semantics independent of representation,

    - all functions are total (or become so using Maybe or Either),

    - compatible error reporting for all packages,

    - avoid name clashes with other packages and assume the regular prelude,

    - performance is NOT a goal - once the program logic is confirmed and tested, performance improvements can be achieved based on observations     

  The packages included here deal with 

    - a generally usable zero (null) value and other simplistic 
    algebras,

    - handling of text independent of represenations and principled conversion between representations,

    - a minimal error reporting as text error messages,

    - bringing together functions to handle time,

    - uniform functions to handle files and filepaths (`Filepath` and `Path`).
